- Background color: Implement noisy gradients using a blend of light oranges and creams to create a surreal and textured backdrop that adds depth and visual interest.
- Accent color: Introduce unexpected pops of contrasting yet harmonious colors like teal or deep blue to create surreal visual accents and draw attention to interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: Maintain 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for primary text but experiment with a secondary display font with unique characteristics, possibly a slightly distorted or unconventional typeface, to enhance the surreal aesthetic.
- Use a set of abstract, custom icons with unconventional shapes and colors, inspired by surrealist art, to represent different financial actions and account types. Consider icons that morph slightly on interaction.
- Incorporate asymmetric and unconventional layouts with overlapping elements and unexpected juxtapositions to create a sense of depth and intrigue. Prioritize a balance between chaos and clarity to maintain usability.
- Introduce fluid and dreamlike transitions and animations with unexpected easing curves and motion paths. Consider animations that defy physics or create a sense of disorientation to enhance the surreal user experience.
